/-! # VC Dimension for Concept Classes

This file defines *shattering* and the *Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension* for
binary concept classes `C : ConceptClass α Bool`, i.e. sets of `α → Bool`
classifiers. Each Boolean classifier `c` is identified with the subset
`c ⁻¹' {true} ⊆ α` (the "positive set"), and `C` shatters a set `W` if every
subset of `W` can be obtained as the positive set of some `c ∈ C` intersected
with `W`. See also the `Finset`-based definitions in
`Mathlib.Combinatorics.SetFamily.Shatter`.

## Main definitions

- `SetShatters C W`: the concept class `C` shatters the set `W`.
- `vcDim C`: the VC dimension of `C`, i.e. the supremum of the cardinalities of
  finite sets shattered by `C`.

## Main statements

- `SetShatters.subset`: shattering is anti-monotone in the shattered set.
- `SetShatters.superset`: shattering is monotone in the concept class.
- `Finset.Shatters.toSetShatters`: bridge from Mathlib's `Finset.Shatters`
  to `SetShatters`.

/-- The *Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension* of a binary concept class `C` is the
supremum of the cardinalities of finite sets shattered by `C`. Returns `0` when
no finite set is shattered (i.e. the defining set is empty).

**Caveat**: because `sSup` on `ℕ` returns `0` for unbounded sets, this definition
is only meaningful when the VC dimension is finite — see `HasFiniteVCDim`. -/

/-- A binary concept class `C` has *finite VC dimension* if there is a uniform
