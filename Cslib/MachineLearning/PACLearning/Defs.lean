/-! # PAC Learning

This file defines the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model
introduced by Valiant [Valiant1984], generalized to an arbitrary label type `β`
and parameterized by a family of distributions `𝒟` on `α × β`.

A concept class `C` over domain `α` with labels in `β` is a collection of
functions `α → β`. A learning algorithm receives a labeled sample drawn i.i.d.
from an unknown joint distribution `D` on `α × β` and must produce a hypothesis
whose 0-1 error is within `ε` of the best concept in `C`, with probability at
least `1 - δ`.

The single definition `IsPACLearnerFor` captures the realizable, agnostic, and
noise-tolerant settings by varying the distribution family `𝒟`:

- **Agnostic** [Haussler1992]: `𝒟 = Set.univ` — the learner must work for all distributions.
- **Realizable**: `𝒟` consists of pushforwards of arbitrary probability measures
  `P` on `α` along the graph `x ↦ (x, c x)` of some concept `c ∈ C`, so that
  `optimalError D C = 0`.
- **Noise-tolerant** [AngluinLaird1988]: `𝒟` consists of noisy versions of realizable
  distributions, where each label is corrupted independently with some probability `η`.

The accuracy and confidence parameters `ε` and `δ` are elements of the subtype
`Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1`, which bundles the value together with the proof that it
lies in the open interval `(0, 1)`, ensuring the learning condition is non-vacuous.

All declarations live under the `Cslib.MachineLearning.PACLearning` namespace so that
generic names like `error` and `optimalError` do not pollute the parent namespace.

## Main definitions

- `ConceptClass`: a set of functions `α → β` (classifiers).
- `LabeledSample`: a finite sequence of `(point, label)` pairs.
- `Learner`: a function from labeled samples to hypotheses.
- `error`: the 0-1 error of a hypothesis under a joint distribution.
- `optimalError`: the infimum of `error` over a concept class.
- `IsPACLearnerFor`: deterministic `(ε, δ)`-PAC learner over a distribution family.
- `IsRPACLearnerFor`: randomized variant of `IsPACLearnerFor`. Universe-polymorphic in the
  randomness space `Ω : Type*`.
- `IsPACLearnable`: a concept class is PAC learnable if `IsPACLearnerFor` holds for
  all `ε, δ : Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1` with some sample size `m`.
- `IsRPACLearnable`: randomized variant of `IsPACLearnable`. Pins the randomness space to
  `Type 0`; `IsRPACLearnerFor` itself remains universe-polymorphic for users who need it.
- `LearnerModel`: the common predicate shape `ℕ → ε → δ → C → 𝒟 → Prop` abstracting both
  the deterministic and randomized learners so sample-complexity lemmas can be shared.
- `sampleComplexity`: sample complexity of a generic learner model.
- `rsampleComplexity`: randomized sample complexity, i.e. `sampleComplexity IsRPACLearnerFor`.

## Binary classification

When `β = Bool`, concepts correspond to subsets of `α`. The section
*Binary Classification* provides:

- `hypothesisError`: the symmetric-difference error `P(h ∆ c)`.
- `falsePositiveError`, `falseNegativeError`: its decomposition.
- `hypothesisError_eq_add`: the decomposition theorem.
- `error_map_eq_hypothesisError`: bridge between the general `error` and
  the binary `hypothesisError` under a realizable distribution.

## Main statements

- `IsPACLearnerFor.toIsRPACLearnerFor`: every deterministic PAC learner is a
  randomized one (via the trivial randomness space `PUnit`).
- `IsPACLearnerFor.antitone_family`, `.antitone_C`: the deterministic PAC learner
  predicate is antitone in the distribution family and concept class.
- `IsPACLearnerFor.mono_δ`, `.mono_ε`: the predicate is monotone in the confidence and
  accuracy parameters (a weaker bound still holds).
- `IsRPACLearnerFor.antitone_family`, `.mono_δ`: analogues for the randomized predicate.
  (`mono_ε` and `antitone_C` are not provided because they change the integrand and
  would require an extra measurability assumption.)
- `IsPACLearnable.toIsRPACLearnable`: deterministic learnability implies randomized.
- `IsPACLearnable.antitone_family`, `.antitone_C`, `IsRPACLearnable.antitone_family`:
  PAC learnability is antitone in the distribution family and concept class.
- `sampleComplexity_antitone_δ`, `_antitone_ε`, `_mono_family`, `_mono_C`: variation of
  deterministic sample complexity in confidence, accuracy, distribution family, and concept
  class (antitone in the numeric parameters, monotone under `⊆` in the set parameters). The
  randomized analogues `rsampleComplexity_antitone_δ` and `_mono_family` are provided.
- `IsPACLearnable.sampleComplexity_*`, `IsRPACLearnable.rsampleComplexity_*`: the same
  monotonicity facts phrased with a learnability hypothesis in place of the ad-hoc
  `∃ m, IsPACLearnerFor m …` existence witness, so callers who already know the class is
  learnable need not thread it through.
- `hypothesisError_eq_add`: total error = false positive + false negative.

/-- A *concept class* over domain `α` with label type `β` is a set of functions `α → β`.
For binary classification (`β = Bool`), this is equivalent to a collection of subsets of `α`
via the characteristic function. -/
abbrev ConceptClass (α β : Type*) := Set (α → β)

/-- A *labeled sample* of size `m` over domain `α` with label type `β` is a finite sequence
of `(point, label)` pairs. -/
abbrev LabeledSample (α β : Type*) (m : ℕ) := Fin m → (α × β)

/-- A *learner* using `m` samples is a function that takes a labeled sample and produces
a hypothesis (a function from the domain to the label type). -/
abbrev Learner (α β : Type*) (m : ℕ) := LabeledSample α β m → (α → β)

variable {α : Type*} {β : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSpace β]

/-- The *prediction error* (0-1 loss) of a hypothesis `h` under a joint distribution `D`
on `α × β`, defined as the probability that the prediction disagrees with the label:
`D({(x, y) | h(x) ≠ y})`. -/
noncomputable def error (D : Measure (α × β)) (h : α → β) : ℝ≥0∞ :=
  D {p : α × β | h p.1 ≠ p.2}

/-- The *optimal error* of a concept class `C` under a joint distribution `D`, defined as the
infimum of `error D c` over all concepts `c ∈ C`. When `C` is empty this is `⊤`, making the
PAC learning condition vacuously true. -/

/-! ### PAC Learners -/

/-- `IsPACLearnerFor m ε δ C 𝒟` asserts that there exists a learner using `m` samples
that is `(ε, δ)`-correct for the concept class `C` over the distribution family `𝒟`: for every
probability measure `D ∈ 𝒟` on `α × β`, the probability (over i.i.d. samples from `D`) that
the learner's hypothesis has error exceeding `opt_C(D) + ε` is at most `δ`.

The parameters `ε` and `δ` are elements of `Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1`, bundling the value with
the proof that it lies in `(0, 1)`. This ensures the condition is non-vacuous:
`ε < 1` prevents the error threshold from exceeding the maximum possible error under a
probability measure, and `δ < 1` prevents the confidence bound from being trivially
satisfied. -/
def IsPACLearnerFor (m : ℕ) (ε δ : Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1)
    (C : ConceptClass α β) (𝒟 : Set (Measure (α × β))) : Prop :=
  ∃ A : Learner α β m,
    ∀ (D : Measure (α × β)) [IsProbabilityMeasure D], D ∈ 𝒟 →
      (Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin m => D))
        {S : LabeledSample α β m |
          error D (A S) > optimalError D C + ↑ε.val} ≤ ↑δ.val

/-- `IsRPACLearnerFor m ε δ C 𝒟` asserts that there exists a *randomized* learner using
`m` samples that is `(ε, δ)`-correct for the concept class `C` over the distribution family
`𝒟`. A randomized learner draws internal randomness `ω` from a probability space `(Ω, Q)` and
acts as the deterministic learner `A(ω)`.

For every probability measure `D ∈ 𝒟`, the failure probability function
`ω ↦ D^m{S | error(A(ω)(S)) > opt_C(D) + ε}` must be `Q`-a.e. measurable, and its
expectation over `ω` must be at most `δ`.

The randomness space `Ω : Type*` is universe-polymorphic; the universe is an implicit
parameter of `IsRPACLearnerFor`, and downstream statements reference it via the pattern
`IsRPACLearnerFor.{_, _, u}`. Fix `u := 0` for the usual case of a standard randomness space.

A deterministic learner (`IsPACLearnerFor`) is the special case `Ω = PUnit`;
see `IsPACLearnerFor.toIsRPACLearnerFor`. -/

/-- A concept class `C` is *PAC learnable* over the distribution family `𝒟` if for every
accuracy `ε ∈ (0, 1)` and confidence `δ ∈ (0, 1)`, there exists a sample size `m` admitting
a deterministic `(ε, δ)`-PAC learner for `C`. Here `ε` and `δ` are elements of the subtype
`Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1`. -/

/-- A concept class `C` is *randomized PAC learnable* over the distribution family `𝒟` if for
every accuracy `ε ∈ (0, 1)` and confidence `δ ∈ (0, 1)`, there exists a sample size `m`
admitting a randomized `(ε, δ)`-PAC learner for `C`. The randomness space is pinned to

/-! ### Sample Complexity -/

/-- A *learner model* is a predicate on (sample size, accuracy, confidence, concept class,
distribution family) that classifies which sample sizes admit a learner of the given kind.
Instantiating with `IsPACLearnerFor` gives the deterministic model; with `IsRPACLearnerFor`
gives the randomized one. -/
abbrev LearnerModel (α β : Type*) [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSpace β] :=
  ℕ → Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1 → Set.Ioo (0 : ℝ≥0) 1 →
    ConceptClass α β → Set (Measure (α × β)) → Prop

/-- The *sample complexity* of a concept class `C` under a learner model `L`, at accuracy
`ε ∈ (0, 1)` and confidence `δ ∈ (0, 1)` over distribution family `𝒟`, is the smallest sample
size `m` with `L m ε δ C 𝒟`. Specialize with `L := IsPACLearnerFor` for the deterministic model
and `L := IsRPACLearnerFor` for the randomized one.

**Caveat**: because `sInf` on `ℕ` returns `0` for the empty set, this definition returns `0`
when no learner exists (e.g., a concept class of infinite VC dimension). It is only meaningful
when the defining set `{m | L m ε δ C 𝒟}` is nonempty. The `IsPACLearnable.sampleComplexity_*`
variants below discharge this nonemptiness from a learnability hypothesis. -/

/-! ### Monotonicity of Sample Complexity

These lemmas are all special cases of the following observation: if `{m | L₁ m ε₁ δ₁ C₁ 𝒟₁} ⊆
{m | L₂ m ε₂ δ₂ C₂ 𝒟₂}` and the first set is nonempty, then the sample complexity under
`(L₂, ε₂, δ₂, C₂, 𝒟₂)` is at most the sample complexity under `(L₁, ε₁, δ₁, C₁, 𝒟₁)`. The
nonemptiness hypothesis is essential: `sInf` on `ℕ` returns `0` for an empty set, so without
it the inequality can fail at the degenerate boundary. The `IsPACLearnable`-flavoured variants
at the end of this section discharge that witness from a learnability hypothesis. -/

/-- General pointwise monotonicity of `sampleComplexity`: if every witness sample size for
`(L₁, ε₁, δ₁, C₁, 𝒟₁)` is also a witness for `(L₂, ε₂, δ₂, C₂, 𝒟₂)`, then the latter's
sample complexity is at most the former's (provided the former is attained). -/

/-! ### Binary Classification

When `β = Bool`, concepts correspond to subsets of `α` via the characteristic function.
The symmetric-difference error `P(h ∆ c)` is the natural error metric, and it decomposes
into false positive and false negative components.

The bridge lemma `error_map_eq_hypothesisError` connects the general `error` on `α × Bool`
to the binary `hypothesisError` on `α`, showing they coincide for realizable distributions. -/
