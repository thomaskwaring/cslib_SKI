# MergeSort on a list

In this file we introduce `merge` and `mergeSort` algorithms that returns a time monad
over the list `TimeM ℕ (List α)`. The time complexity of `mergeSort` is the number of comparisons.

--
## Main results

- `mergeSort_correct`: `mergeSort` permutes the list into a sorted one.
- `mergeSort_time`:  The number of comparisons of `mergeSort` is at most `n*⌈log₂ n⌉`.

  then merge (which takes at most `n` comparisons) -/
