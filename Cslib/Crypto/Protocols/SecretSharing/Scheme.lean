# Secret Sharing Schemes

A secret-sharing scheme bundles the deterministic sharing/reconstruction
interface, the distribution on randomness, and privacy for unauthorized
coalitions.

## Main definitions

- `Cslib.Crypto.Protocols.SecretSharing.Scheme`:
  a secret-sharing scheme with correctness and privacy
- `Cslib.Crypto.Protocols.SecretSharing.Scheme.view`:
  the restricted shares seen by one coalition

/--
A secret-sharing scheme over secret space `Secret`, randomness space
`Randomness`, party set `Party`, and share space `Share`.

Correctness is deterministic: every authorized coalition reconstructs the
secret from the shares generated using any randomness seed. Privacy is
distributional: unauthorized coalitions have the same view distribution for all
secrets.
