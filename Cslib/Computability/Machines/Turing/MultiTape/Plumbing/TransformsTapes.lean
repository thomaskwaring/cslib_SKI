# Machines as transformers of tape words

The interface through which combinators use machines: a machine reads words from its work tapes
and leaves words on them. A combinator composing such machines talks about words only, never about
individual cells, head positions or the set of tapes a machine has touched.

Configurations are described by *equalities*: `wordsCfg input q ws out` is the configuration whose
work tape `i` holds exactly the word `ws i` (contents `tapeOfList (ws i)`, head at the start), with
the input head at the start of the input and output `out`. A specification
`TransformsTapes tm P Q t s` says: started on word-holding tapes satisfying `P`, after exactly `t`
steps the machine sits in the halted *normal form* `wordsCfg input none ws' out` (every head reset
to its initial position, tapes blank outside their words, output untouched), with the new words
related to the old ones by `Q` and using at most `s` work-tape cells. The machine may halt earlier
than `t`; since a halted machine stays put and stops visiting new cells, running on to `t` costs
nothing, so a fixed step count loses no generality and spares every composition an existential.
Requiring this normal form is what lets specifications compose by rewriting: the halting
configuration of one machine is already a valid start for the next, so which words survived a step
is read off the equation, not re-established cell by cell.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.TransformsTapes`: the specification format described above.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.nop`: the machine that does nothing.

## Main results

* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.TransformsTapes.imp`: strengthen the precondition, weaken the postcondition
  and raise the bounds.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.transformsTapes_nop`: `nop` leaves every word as it was, the first machine of
  the interface and the check that the format is inhabited as intended.

/-- `TransformsTapes tm P Q t s`: started in its initial state on tapes holding words `ws` that
satisfy the precondition `P`, the machine is halted after exactly `t` steps in the configuration
whose tapes hold words `ws'` with `Q input ws ws'`, having used at most `s` work-tape cells. The
machine is free to halt before step `t`, because it then stays in that configuration.

The bounds are numbers; a specification whose bounds depend on the data is a *family*
