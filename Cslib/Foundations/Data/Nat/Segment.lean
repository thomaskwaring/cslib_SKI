# Segments defined by a strictly monotonic function on Nat

Given a strictly monotonic function `f : ℕ → ℕ` and `k : ℕ` with `k ≥ f 0`,
`Nat.segment f k` is the unique `m : ℕ` such that `f m ≤ k < f (k + 1)`.
`Nat.segment f k` is defined to be 0 for `k < f 0`.
This file defines `Nat.segment` and proves various properties about it.
