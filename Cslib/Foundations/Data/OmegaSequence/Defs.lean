# Definition of `ωSequence` and functions on infinite sequences

An `ωSequence α` is an infinite sequence of elements of `α`.  It is basically
a wrapper around the type `ℕ → α` which supports the dot-notation and
the analogues of many familiar API functions of `List α`.  In particular,
the element at position `n : ℕ` of `s : ωSequence α` is obtained using the
function application notation `s n`.

In this file we define `ωSequence` and its API functions.
Most code below is adapted from Mathlib.Data.Stream.Defs.
