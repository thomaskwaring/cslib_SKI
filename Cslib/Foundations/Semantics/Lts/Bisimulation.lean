/-! # Bisimulation and Bisimilarity

A bisimulation is a binary relation on the states of an `Lts`, which establishes a tight semantic
correspondence. More specifically, if two states `s1` and `s2` are related by a bisimulation, then
`s1` can mimic all transitions of `s2` and vice versa. Furthermore, the derivatives reaches through
these transitions remain related by the bisimulation.

Bisimilarity is the largest bisimulation: given an `Lts`, it relates any two states that are related
by a bisimulation for that Lts.

Weak bisimulation (resp. bisimilarity) is the relaxed version of bisimulation (resp. bisimilarity)
whereby internal actions performed by processes can be ignored.

For an introduction to theory of bisimulation, we refer to [Sangiorgi2011].

## Main definitions

- `lts.IsBisimulation r`: the relation `r` is a bisimulation for the LTS `lts`.
- `Bisimilarity lts` is the binary relation on the states of `lts` that relates any two states
related by some bisimulation on `lts`.
- `lts.IsBisimulationUpTo r`: the relation `r` is a bisimulation up to bisimilarity (this is known
as one of the 'up to' techniques for bisimulation).

- `lts.IsWeakBisimulation r`: the relation `r` on the states of the Lts `lts` is a weak
bisimulation.
- `WeakBisimilarity lts` is the binary relation on the states of `lts` that relates any two states
related by some weak bisimulation on `lts`.
- `lts.IsSWBisimulation` is a more convenient definition for establishing weak bisimulations, which
we prove to be sound and complete.
- `SWBisimilarity lts` is the binary relation on the states of `lts` that relates any two states
related by some sw-bisimulation on `lts`.

## Notations

- `s1 ~[lts] s2`: the states `s1` and `s2` are bisimilar in the Lts `lts`.
- `s1 ≈[lts] s2`: the states `s1` and `s2` are weakly bisimilar in the Lts `lts`.
- `s1 ≈sw[lts] s2`: the states `s1` and `s2` are sw bisimilar in the Lts `lts`.

## Main statements

- `Bisimulation.inv`: the inverse of a bisimulation is a bisimulation.
- `Bisimilarity.eqv`: bisimilarity is an equivalence relation (see `Equivalence`).
- `Bisimilarity.is_bisimulation`: bisimilarity is itself a bisimulation.
- `Bisimilarity.largest_bisimulation`: bisimilarity is the largest bisimulation.
- `Bisimilarity.gfp`: the union of bisimilarity and any bisimulation is equal to bisimilarity.
- `Bisimulation.upTo_bisimulation`: any bisimulation up to bisimilarity is a bisimulation.
- `Bisimulation.bisim_traceEq`: any bisimulation that relates two states implies that they are
trace equivalent (see `TraceEq`).
- `Bisimilarity.deterministic_bisim_eq_traceEq`: in a deterministic Lts, bisimilarity and trace
equivalence coincide.
- `WeakBisimilarity.weakBisim_eq_swBisim`: weak bisimilarity and sw-bisimilarity coincide in all
Ltss.
- `WeakBisimilarity.eqv`: weak bisimilarity is an equivalence relation.
- `SWBisimilarity.eqv`: sw-bisimilarity is an equivalence relation.
