/-! # IsSimulation and Similarity

A simulation is a binary relation on the states of two `LTS`s: if two states `s₁` and `s2` are
related by a simulation, then `s2` can mimic all transitions of `s₁` in their respective LTSs.
Furthermore, the derivatives reaches through these transitions remain related by the simulation.

Similarity is the largest simulation: given an `LTS`, it relates any two states that are related
by a simulation for that LTS.

The module provides abbreviations for the homogeneous case of comparing states in the same LTS.

For an introduction to theory of simulation, we refer to [Sangiorgi2011].

## Main definitions

- `IsSimulation lts₁ lts₂ r`: the relation `r` on the states of `lts₁` and `lts₂` is a simulation.
- `Similarity lts₁ lts₂` is the binary relation that relates any two states related by some
simulation on `lts₁` and `lts₂`.
- `SimulationEquiv lts₁ lts₂` is the binary relation on the states of `lts₁` and `lts₂` that relates
any two states similar to each other.

## Notations

- `s₁ ≤[lts₁, lts₂] s₂`: the states `s₁` and `s2` are similar under `lts₁` and `lts₂`.
- `s₁ ≤≥[lts₁, lts₂] s2`: the states `s₁` and `s2` are simulation equivalent under `lts₁` and
`lts₂`.

## Main statements

- `HomSimulationEquiv.eqv`: homogeneous simulation equivalence is an equivalence relation.
